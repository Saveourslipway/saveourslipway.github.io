                <p>Friends of Clevedon Slipway is a new group, formed in response to funding and participation opportunities under North Somerset District Council’s “Great Lakes” programme.</p>
                <p>Because such diverse groups and individuals use the slipway for free, as and when they want to, it has never been necessary, nor simple to form a user group before.</p>
                <p>Suddenly, we have had to move very quickly and we are in the process of putting together a Steering Group, representing every class of user, to take the Save Our Slipway campaign forward.</p>
                <p>To date the steering group comprises:</p>
                <p><b>Tony Cherry, Acting Chair</b></p>
                <p>Tony has lived in Clevedon for twenty years , is a former Trustee of Marlens and a Director of the Sailing Club.  He is also a Trustee of The Bristol Beacon, a Director of the Cabot Learning Federation and a Governor of Queen Elizabeth’s Hospital School.</p>
                <p><b>Paul Anslow</b></p>
                <p>President of Clevedon Chamber of Commerce and Managing Director of Triangle networks, Paul is also a Thundercat enthusiast, instrumental in bringing the event to the town.</p>
                <p><b>Trevor Baker</b></p>
                <p>Trevor is Commodore of Clevedon Sailing Club and longtime Clevedon resident, with a special knowledge of the slipway and threat to its structure.</p>
                <p><b>Brian Gribben</b></p>
                <p>Brian is a Gig Club member living in the immediate seafront area and with a strong commitment to collaborative solutions for the many challenges the area faces.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>We are in discussion with a range of people who we hope will join the steering group.  If you would like to participate let us know.  We are particularly interested in improving our diversity and in involving casual users of the slipway.</p>
