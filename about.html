                <p>Friends of Clevedon Slipway is a new group, formed in response to funding and participation opportunities under North Somerset District Council’s “Great Lakes” programme.</p>
                <p>Because such diverse groups and individuals use the slipway for free, as and when they want to, it has never been necessary, nor simple to form a user group before.</p>
                <p>Suddenly, we have had to move very quickly and we are in the process of putting together a Steering Group, representing every class of user, to take the Save Our Slipway campaign forward.  Full details of the steering group will appear here in due course.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, Clevedon Sailing Club, one of the slipway users, has kindly taken the lead and any queries concerning this site can be directed to the Commodore, Trevor Baker by email to Saveourslipway@btinternet.com.</p>
