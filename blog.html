                    <p>We’ve made good progress with developing the Steering Group, a vital step in demonstrating that from the outset any public funds made available would be properly controlled and the project subject to good governance and scrutiny.  Brian Gribben, (a resident of the immediate sea-front area and Gig Club member) and Paul Anslow  (Managing Director of Triangle Networks, President of Clevedon Chamber of Commerce and keen Thundercat owner) have both kindly agreed to join the group.  Increasing the independence from the Sailing Club, whose leadership so far has been invaluable, Trevor Baker, (Commodore) will continue on the steering group, but Tony Cherry (former Marlens Trustee, Sailing Club member, Trustee of Bristol Beacon, Director of the Cabot Learning Federation and Governor of QEH school) will take over the lead role pending election of a Chair when the steering group is complete.</p>

                        <p>It’s premature to go into too much detail and we certainly don’t want to prejudice the outcome, but we’re very pleased that a channel with NSDC has opened up that could lead to progress.  As we said in our first blog, ownership certainly isn’t simple.  We’re not saying NSDC definitely own the slipway. What we are saying is that nor is it definite that they don’t.  It could be ownerless, but we think on the balance of probabilities they own it and that an application for first registration in their name would be successful.  Suffice it to say, it’s all quite difficult and we certainly want to focus on solutions, not slinging mud!</p>

                        <p>Most people don’t care who owns Clevedon Slipway – they just want it made safe and secure for everyone who loves it! We agree.  Our primary aim is to work in collaboration with North Somerset District Council and all stakeholders to achieve just that.</p>
                        <p>The problem is that the money to complete projects like this comes from funding organisations that will only consider applications where the owner can be clearly identified.  Quite right too; who would want Lottery Fund or Sports England money going to some shadowy, unidentified private owner?</p>
                        <p>Somebody must own Clevedon Slipway.  Somebody built it, somebody has controlled its use – but who – and why wouldn’t they want to claim ownership?</p>

                <div class="blog_text">
                    <p>Well, the trouble is that although Clevedon Slipway is a fantastic community asset, enabling a wide range of leisure activities, in cold, hard financial terms it’s not an asset at all, it’s a liability.  It requires maintenance and if somebody is injured on it, they may claim it’s the owner’s fault (though, that’s too simple – that sort of liability to injured third parties has much more to do with “Occupation” than it does with ownership).</p>
                </div>
                <div class="blog_text">
                    <p>To cut to the chase, NSDC say “the title of the land isn’t registered to us, so we don’t own it”.  There’s no easy way to say this.  We believe that’s just wrong in law.  If the title to (ownership of) land is registered to you, then that’s proof you own it – makes it nice and easy when you want to buy or sell your house!  It doesn’t work the other way round though.  If you aren’t registered with ownership, that doesn’t mean you don’t own it, particularly if title isn’t registered at all.</p>
                    <p>You don’t need to rely on us on this.  If you want to check, <a href="https://hmlandregistry.blog.gov.uk/2018/02/05/search-owner-unregistered-land/">look here</a>. This is what the Land Registry itself, a government body, says about it.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="blog_text">
                    <p>Essentially, where nobody is registered with Title it’s a matter of evidence who owns it.  It seems a real shame that a public authority should take a very doubtful legal point against the whole community they are supposed to represent, but that’s what’s happened.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="blog_text">
                    <p>“Well,” you might say “why don’t you supply NSDC with the evidence they need to prove they own it?”.  Some industrious sailing club members did that three years ago.  There’s an incredibly thorough sixty page dossier outlining why, by reference to the indications in the Land Registry blog, NSDC obviously own the slipway.  Both the former Leader and an officer were given copies and it’s been expressly pointed out to the current administration. Regrettably there has been no attempt to address it.</p>
                    <p>One fact that points to ownership is ownership of adjoining land.  Why NSDC registered title to the landward end of the slip on transfer from Woodspring but not the seaward end can only be a matter of speculation, but of course the financial risks will have been obvious even then.</p>

                        <p>We were asked in a comment on a Facebook post, “Why doesn’t the Sailing Club claim ownership?”  Well, although as the only slipway user group that has a presence on the seafront, some sailing club members have taken the lead in setting up the Friends of Clevedon Slipway, this group is for all slipway users, organised or casual and we don’t speak for the Sailing Club, but here’s an answer that applies to anyone who might want to claim ownership.</p>

                        <p>First, there’s no way any of the possible groups can prove ownership.  They would have to rely on a legal principle known as “adverse possession”.  This means that the actual owner knows that the claimant has been using the land without permission and has done nothing about it for an extended period.  That just won’t work here.  There isn’t an established owner (who admits they are the owner!) who could have done anything about use by others, so there is nobody against whom the possession could be adverse.  Perhaps that could be got round, but NSDC have from time to time shut off access so that nobody could demonstrate continuous use.  When emergency repair works have been done, NSDC have granted permission, so the essential requirements couldn’t be met.  Nor could any organisation prove that they’d had exclusive possession, barring others from access.</p>

                <div class="blog_text">
                    <p>Secondly, no small organisation could or should take on the responsibility for an expensive community asset that creates liabilities too big for its balance sheet.  No responsible board could risk a group’s assets in that way.  No sensible Director or Trustee would risk trading insolvent.</p>

                        <p>Interestingly, NSDC themselves have already recognised this principle.  A look at the Annual Reports of the Marlens Trust on the Charity Commission website reveals that they took a very pragmatic and sensible approach there, retaining ownership of the Marine Lake, granting a lease, indemnifying against risks the Trust couldn’t bear and keeping the liability to the public insured in their name on their policy.</p>
                        <p>This was a really brilliant move by NSDC to support their community and opened up a hugely successful renaissance for the lake led by the Trust and its resourceful Chair.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="blog_text">
                        <p>That’s fantastic, because it points to a solution!  The model can work for all community assets.  We at Friends of Clevedon Slipway would be happy to form a Trust to hold the Slipway on the same terms as Marlens hold the Lake.</p>
                        <p>Better still, we’re all about collaboration and teamwork (anything to do with the risks of the sea needs that) so we’d love to talk about a single Trust to hold all seafront assets (except of course the Pier) on the same terms.</p>
